# ConnectTheDots
Connect the dots is a two player game where each user draw a line from the dots infront of them. They would need to close a box to score a point. 
Player with the most points win. This is a two player game. It's created in java and you need JVM to run the application. It's not packaged as an application 
to make it easier for develpers to modify it. This was a class project developed by me. I can modify it if you have any idea for the application. You can also 
feel free to modify the application.
